# Excel Statistical Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **statistical data analysis using Microsoft Excel** on a real-world dataset.
The analysis focuses on understanding data distribution, variability, relationships between variables,
and detecting outliers using Excel’s built-in statistical functions.

The project is structured as a **single Excel workbook with multiple analytical sheets**.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following variables:
- Age
- Salary
- Purchase_Count
- Satisfaction_Score
- Visit_Frequency

These fields are used to perform both **descriptive and inferential statistical analysis**.

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed

### 🔹 Descriptive Statistics
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Variance
- Coefficient of Variation

Functions used:
- AVERAGE
- MEDIAN
- MODE
- STDEV.S
- VAR.S

---

### 🔹 Distribution Analysis
- Skewness analysis for Purchase_Count
- Kurtosis analysis to understand data shape

Functions used:
- SKEW
- KURT

---

### 🔹 Correlation Analysis
- Correlation between **Salary** and **Satisfaction_Score**
- Interpretation of correlation strength and direction

Function used:
- CORREL

---

### 🔹 Outlier Detection
- Identification of outliers in Satisfaction_Score
- Standard deviation method (Mean ± 2 × SD)
- Conclusion based on calculated range

---

### 🔹 Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Calculation of Q1, Q3
- IQR computation for Purchase_Count
- Spread and variability analysis

Functions used:
- QUARTILE.INC

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Salary shows a very weak and slightly negative correlation with satisfaction score
- Satisfaction scores fall within acceptable statistical limits
- Purchase count distribution is nearly symmetric
- Salary shows high variability as indicated by the coefficient of variation
